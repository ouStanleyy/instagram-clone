Later, they moved back to the USA and Kobe went to the Lower Merion High School where his basketball career really took off. Bryant, who played at the shooting guard position, received some of the most famous basketball accolades for players who are still in high school. This made young Kobe Bryant declare for the NBA draft straight out of high school, opting out of the college experience. He was only the sixth player to declare for the draft straight out of high school."
